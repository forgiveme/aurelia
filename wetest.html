We are passionate about providing women with revolutionary, next generation probiotic technology combined with ethically sourced BioOrganic botanical formulations. Our scientifically proven, evidence based probiotic technology works by helping to manage the level of inflammation within the skin to achieve the perfect balance. The technologies we use help protect against skin ageing, regenerate cell metabolism for improved cell turnover, prevent cellular DNA damage, boost hyaluronic acid by nineteen times and increase collagen production by 140% leaving you with glowing radiant skin.
