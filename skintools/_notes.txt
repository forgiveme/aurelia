#DB Set-up

##1 Make DB on the localhost with the following login info...

db location = "localhost";
db user     = "v8dz4vcugc4yuu5i";

db name		= "AureliaSkinDB";



##2 Import AureliaSkinDB.sql or AureliaSkinDB.xml file in _HANDOVER directory.

The admin area requires PHP with a version >= 5.3.7 - It uses php-login-minimal from

#Todo before launch

##1 Batch replace "v8dz4vcugc4yuu5i7c2x.wallacetestbed.co.uk" with the domain in which the tool 
will sit.

e.g "v8dz4vcugc4yuu5i7c2x.wallacetestbed.co.uk" to become "tool.aureliaskincare.com"
